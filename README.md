# XYZReader

The XYZReader is a mock RSS feed reader android application featuring banner photos and shocking headlines! 
 This project is part of Udacity Nanodegree course where the code was given and we had to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

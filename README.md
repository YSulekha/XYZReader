# Stock Hawk

The Stock Hawk is an Android application for displaying the stock values from Yahoo finance API. 
 This project is part of Udacity Nanodegree course where the code was given and we had to productionize the app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This involved finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.
